#User Story

AS A hungry customer with hearing and vocal impairments

I WANT to view a menu, place an order, and see my receipt

SO THAT I don't have to interact with a person until I collect my food

##Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN A restaurant order system

WHEN I launch the program

THEN I view all of the menu items listed with their category, name, and price

THEN I am asked the quantity of that item I want to order

WHEN I choose the quantity

THEN I am asked if I would like to continue ordering or not

WHEN I don't choose a valid quantity

THEN I automatically receive 1 of that menu item

WHEN I continue ordering

THEN I view the menu again

WHEN I quit ordering

THEN I am shown my itemized order receipt and total price

WHEN I enter an invalid response for the menu item

THEN I am given an error message
